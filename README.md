## Whats is it?
This is assignment 1 for IDG1293 Spring 2022 at NTNU in Gj√∏vik. For this assignment we created the front-end graphics for a delivery application. This website consists of 4 pages. A landing page with a truck, a package pick up page, a transport to customer page, and finally a delivery to customer page.
